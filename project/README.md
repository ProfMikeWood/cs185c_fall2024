# California Upwelling

This modeling project is an example to demonstrate the approximate scope, files, and organization of a class project for CS 185C.

## Project Description
In this project, I will investigate the effects of coastal wind on upwelling in California. In particular, I will investigate the following science question:

*How do winds affect ocean temperature in the California Current?*

To investigate this question, I will run my model simulation for one year in two experiments: a run with wind and a run without wind. I will run my experiment during the year 2008 which is a year of strong upwelling as shown in the [BEUTI Index](https://ecowatch.noaa.gov/thematic/upwelling). For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January of 2008. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will create a timeseries of temperature in the Monterey Bay area in the two models and investigate differences through time. For visualization, I will create a movie of temperature differences between the model with wind and the model without wind.
